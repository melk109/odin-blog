        <p>Today is the first day of week 3! I'm starting out at <strong>44%</strong> course completion, and my goal is to finish the week at 54%.
            <p>Today I'm starting CSS. I think that instead of going back and "styling" the previous work on this site, I'll just "style" moving forward so that I can go back and see a clear progression of skills.</p>

        <p>I tried working on the course today while waiting at the car dealership, but nothing was sticking. I had to reread and rewatch so much content.</p>

    <div class="descrip"></div>
        <p>Things started sticking today. I was really productive overall, and was able to get through the 6 practice exercises on Odin. Still need to use what I've learned to spruce up my <a href="https://melk109.github.io/odin-recipes/index.html">recipe website</a></p>

        <h3>I'm still at 44% completion :( but hopefully next week I'll make more progress!</h3>
