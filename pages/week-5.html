        <p>After a long break, I'm coming back to TOP. I got super busy at work and then the holidays hit so I didn't get anything done, but now I'm hoping to make more progress. Today I'm going back and rewatching some videos to make sure I remember everything. I'm also setting up this page as a refresher.</p>
        <p>I'm starthing this week at 44% course completion. My goal will be to get to 48% by the end of the week.</p>

        <h2 class="day">Tuesday</h2>
        <p>Today I'm working on <span class="box">CSS Box Model</span>. Yesterday I got though <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6coJNLFBWI&list=PL4-IK0AVhVjM0xE0K2uZRvsM7LkIhsPT-&index=12>this video</a> and today I've been working my way through <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model>this article</a>. I now know that the box model includes different components: the content, padding, border, and margin. I'm still a bit confused on the inline and block stuff, but I'm hoping I have the basics down and can move forward.</p>

        <p>Didn't make too much progress today.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="days">
        <h2 class="day">Thursday</h2>
        <p>Today I'm reading a lot about inline, block, inline-block and I'm trying to change the layout of this page so that the days of the week align right next to each other like a 7 cell table, but it's not turning out how I'd like it to.</p>
