        <p>I'm starting out the week after having finished 44% of the course. My goal for this week is to get up to 50% course completion. Last week I barely made any progress, so I'm trying to set myself a more realistic goal this week.</p>
        
        <h3 class="day">Friday</h3>
        <p>Once again I'm rereading and rewatching to try to figure all of this out. I <em>think</em> concepts are finally starting to click, but I'm not 100% sure still. Late last night I posted a question about my code on Reddit and read through my responses today and I think that helped. I just realized that I can assign classes to my headers and paragraphs; I don't have to make separate divs for each heading and each chunk of text.</p>
    
        <h3 class="day">Saturday</h3>
        <p>I'm up early today because I'm proctoring the ACT. I'm trying to get a little work done beforehand and then I want to read some CSS articles while I'm there. <span>I'm determined to get past this section of the course today!</span></p>
